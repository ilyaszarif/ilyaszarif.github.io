I started my joint PhD on November 04, 2024 between [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en) and [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Professsor Carsten Rahbek](https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/da/persons/carsten-rahbek) and [Associate Professor Damien Fordham](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/damien.fordham). The research will try to investigate recovery of large bodied herbivores and their ecosystem services using process-based models. 

I have my second masters [MSc Applied Data Science (Ecology and Evolution)](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/mathematics/appdataeco/) at [University of Exeter](https://exeter.ac.uk/) Penryn Campus, Cornwall England. I did my dissertation project on Differential Gene Expression in Japanese Quails, under the supervision of [Dr Bram Kuijper](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Bram_Kuijper).

I got my first master degree in Zoology with Wildlife Ecology major from [Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan](https://qau.edu.pk). As this was a research based degree, I conducted intensive field work utilizing Camera trapping and non-invasive genetic sampling to document the abundance and density of Mammals with a focus on large carnivores and there prey species. I worked in the rugged and inhospitable mountainous terrain of Himalayas and Hindukush across Northern Pakistan. All of these fields were carried out under the supervision and generous support of [Dr Muhammad Ali Nawaz](http://qufaculty.qu.edu.qa/anawaz/).
