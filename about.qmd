subtitle: "Let me briefly introduce myself"

I'm a Master student at [University of Exeter](https://exeter.ac.uk/) Penryn Campus, Cornwall England, where I'm studying towards my second master [MSc Applied Data Science (Ecology and Evolution)](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/mathematics/appdataeco/). I'm working on my dissertation project on Differential Gene Expression in Japanese Quails, under the supervision of [Dr Bram Kuijper](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Bram_Kuijper).

Before coming to [University of Exeter](https://exeter.ac.uk/), I got my first master degree in Zoology with Wildlife Ecology major from [Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan](https://qau.edu.pk). As this was a research based degree, I conducted intensive field work utilizing Camera trapping and non-invasive genetic sampling to document the abundance and density of Mammals with a focus on large carnivores and there prey species. I worked in the rugged and inhospitable mountainous terrain of Himalayas and Hindukush across Northern Pakistan. All of these fields were carried out under the supervision and generous support of [Dr Muhammad Ali Nawaz](http://qufaculty.qu.edu.qa/anawaz/).

I am active on Twitter and regularly re-tweet PhD opportunities relevant to Ecology and Evolution; occasionally for other subjects too.
