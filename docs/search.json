    "text": "I’m a Master student at University of Exeter Penryn Campus, Cornwall England, where I’m studying towards my second master MSc Applied Data Science (Ecology and Evolution). I’m working on my dissertation project on Differential Gene Expression in Japanese Quails, under the supervision of Dr Bram Kuijper.\nBefore coming to University of Exeter, I got my first master degree in Zoology with Wildlife Ecology major from Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan. As this was a research based degree, I conducted intensive field work utilizing Camera trapping and non-invasive genetic sampling to document the abundance and density of Mammals with a focus on large carnivores and there prey species. I worked in the rugged and inhospitable mountainous terrain of Himalayas and Hindukush across Northern Pakistan. All of these fields were carried out under the supervision and generous support of Dr Muhammad Ali Nawaz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstore Camera Trapping November 2018."
